# Harvard Applied Math 205: Code examples
Harvard AM205 is a graduate course the provides a broad overview of scientific
computing. This Git repository contains example codes from the course taught by
[Chris H. Rycroft](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~chr) from 2014 to 2021, and
the main website is now located here:

https://people.math.wisc.edu/~chr/am205

The codes are primarily written in Python, and make use of several
commonly-used libraries:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org) for numerical linear algebra
- [SciPy](https://scipy.org) for scientific routines and algorithms
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) for graphing and visualization

In addition, a number of programs output data to text in a format that can be
read by the freeware plotting program [Gnuplot](http://gnuplot.info).

## Organization
The course is divided into six units:

- [Unit 0](0_overview) – Overview of Scientific Computing
- [Unit 1](1_data_fitting) – Data Fitting
- [Unit 2](2_num_lin_alg) – Numerical Linear Algebra
- [Unit 3](3_num_calculus) – Numerical Calculus and Differential Equations
- [Unit 4](4_optimization) – Nonlinear Equations and Optimization
- [Unit 5](5_eig_problems) – Eigenvalue Problems

Example codes from each unit are provided in separate directories.
